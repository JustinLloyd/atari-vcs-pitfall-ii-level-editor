About
=====
This is an Atari VCS Pitfall II level editor based on the same code as the
Pitfall II Level Designer. They may actually be identical, it has been 13 years
since I looked at this code.

With this level editor you can re-create the Atari 2600 Pitfall II ROM image 
with new level layouts and such.

Pre-requisites
==============
1. VisualBASIC 6


Support
=======
Absolutely none provided.
